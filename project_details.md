I want to build my portfolio site using next.js, shadcn, tailwindcss
The site should have the following pages:
- Home
- About
- Projects
- Contact

- The home page should have a header with a navigation menu and a footer with social media links.
- The about page should have a short bio and a list of skills.
- The projects page should have a list of projects with a link to the project details page.
- The contact page should have a form with a name, email, message, and a submit button.

- The project details page should have a title, a description, a list of technologies used, and a link to the project repository.
- The project details section should also have a filter to filter the projects by technology and a search bar to search for a project.

- The navigation bar should also have a dark mode toggle button.
- There should also be a button to download my resume.
- There should also be a button to "scroll to top"

Take inspiration from https://nextjs-tailwindcss-portfolio.vercel.app/ and for the " Download Resume" button, use https://www.behance.net/gallery/187470735/Portfolio-website-for-full-stack-developer as a reference.
